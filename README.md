# Project 3: EU Quiz Application
v2.4 of Udacity Project 3 - Quiz application

# Description
The Quiz App project was a chance for me to combine and practice everything I learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. I made my own Android app - taking it from the idea stage to building out the full app.

The goal was to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of my choice. I took full ownership of the creative vision, planning, and development of the app. I was responsible for:
- Planning my app design before coding.
- Taking an app layout from drawing to XML code.
- Creating, positioning, and styling views.
- Creating interactivity through button clicks and Java code.
- Commenting and documenting my code.

The app in itself contains a loading screen which later allows the user to enter their name. Then it contains 10 questions related to the European Union. 8 of the questions are of the single correct answer type, the 9th question contains multiple correct answers, the 10th question is requiring the user to manually enter the answer. After each answer, the app informs the users how many questions they have answered. At the end there is a results page, which depending on the success of the users will display a different message and emoticon, combined with user's total score. The app then lets the user close or retake the test, or visit the website of the European Parliament or European Commission for further information.

# Requirements
The design must include:
- Layout:
  - App contains 4 - 10 questions, including at least one checkbox, one radio button, and one text entry.
  - Questions are in a variety of formats such as free text response, checkboxes, and radio buttons. Checkboxes are only used for questions with multiple right answers. Radio buttons are only used for questions with a single right answer.
  - App includes a button for the user to submit their answers and receive a score. 
  - The code adheres to all of the following best practices:
    - Text sizes are defined in sp
    - Lengths are defined in dp
    - Padding and margin are used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.
  - The app includes at least four of the following Views: TextView, ImageView, Button, Checkbox, EditText, LinearLayout, RelativeLayout, ScrollView, RadioButton, RadioGroup.
  - The app gracefully handles displaying all the content on screen when rotated. Either by updating the layout, adding a scrollable feature or some other mechanism that adheres to Android development guidelines.
- Functionality:
  - The code runs without errors.
  - Each question has a correct answer.
  - Any question which uses radio buttons allows only one to be checked at once.
  - The app contains at least one if/else statement
  - The grading button displays a toast which accurately displays the results of the quiz.
  - The grading logic checks each answer correctly. The app accurately calculates the number of correct answers and does not include incorrect answers in the count. Note: When applicable, in the grading logic remember to check that the correct answers are checked AND the incorrect answers are not checked.
- Code Readability:
  - All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.
  - The code is properly formatted i.e. there are no unnecessary blank lines; there are no unused variables or methods; there is no commented out code. The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.
